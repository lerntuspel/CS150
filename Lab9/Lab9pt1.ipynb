        "The Syracuse problem (also known variously as the 3x+1 problem, the Collatz Conjecture, or Kakutani's problem) concerns a strange collection of sequences. For every positive integer, there is a Syracuse sequence. For example, Syracuse sequence 17 is\n",

In particular, f(x) = 3x+1 if x is odd, and f(x) = x/2 if x is even. Once f(x) is equal to 1, you stop (you could keep going, but at this point we'd just cycle between 4, 2 and 1, so generally we stop the sequence at 1). As another example, Syracuse sequence 14 looks like\n",

In other words, it is possible that for some starting numbers, the corresponding Syracuse sequences never get to 1.

So rec(4) should return 3, rec(17) should return 13, and rec(28) should return 19. You may find it helpful to temporarily use print statements within your recursive function so you can see whether it is behaving as intended, but be sure to remove these once you get it working.\n",
