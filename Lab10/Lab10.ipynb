        "\n",
        "The Game of Life, created by mathematician John Conway, is what is referred to as a cellular automaton. It is a set of rules which are used to generate patterns that evolve over time. Despite the name, the Game of Life is not a game; it is really a simulation. In some ways, it can be thought of as an extremely simplified biological simulator which produces unexpectedly complex behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Game of Life is played on an infinite board made up of square cells. It takes way too long to draw an infinite board, so we'll make do with a small finite piece. Each cell can be either live or dead. We'll indicate a live cell as a red square, and a dead cell as a black one. The board begins in some initial configuration, which just mean a setting of each cell to be either live or dead (generally we'll start mostly dead cells, and only a few live cells).\n",
        "\n",
        "![A configuration of a 10-by-10 portion of the board with 9 live cells.](http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~ctaylor/classes/old/150SP14/lab05/ex1.bmp)\n",
        "\n",
        "A configuration of a 10-by-10 portion of the board with 9 live cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "The board is repeatedly updated according to a set of rules, thereby generating a new configuration based on the previous configuration. Some dead cells will become live, some live cells will die, and some cells will be unchanged. This configuration is then updated according to those same rules, producing yet another configuration. This continues in a series of rounds indefinitely (or until you get bored of running your simulation).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rules of Life**\n",
        "\n",
        "The rules are pretty simple: to figure out whether a cell (x,y) will be live or dead in the following round, you just look at the 8 neighbors of that cell (those that share a corner or an edge, so N, S, W, E, NW, NE, SW and SE). What happens to (x,y) next round depends on the number of its neighbors who are live and whether it is currently live or not. In particular:\n",
        "\n",
        "If a cell has 4 or more live neighbors, it dies (overcrowding).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   If a cell has 0 or 1 live neighbors, it dies\n",
        "*   If a cell has exactly 2 live neighbors, nothing changes (if it was live, it stays live, if it was dead, it stays dead)\n",
        "* If a cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it comes to life \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the following 3 initial configurations, and the two configurations that follow each.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Three initial configurations and two subsequent iterations.](http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~ctaylor/classes/old/150SP14/lab05/ex2.bmp)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first example, both live cells have only one live neighbor, so they both die. Any dead cell has at most two live neighbors, so no new live cells spawn. Thus in one step, there are no live cells. Clearly, at this point, the configuration is stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the second example, two live cells have only one neighbor, so both die. But the third cell lives, and the cell to its immediate left has exactly 3 live neighbors, so it spawns. On the next iteration, we find ourselves in a case similar to the previous example, and all cells die.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that we can't set a cell to be live or dead the instant we determine its status for the subsequent round; we will likely need to know whether it is alive or dead on this round to determine the future status of other nearby cells. To see this, consider the second example. We can immediately tell that the top-most live cell will die. But had we set it to dead immediately, then when we got to the second live cell, it would have only had 1 live neighbor and we would have (erroneously) determined that it too must die. Thus it is critical that we first determine for every cell whether or not it will be live, and only after doing so update the status of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last example, all currently living cells die; the middle cell has too many neighbors, and the other have too few. However, four dead cells have exactly 3 live neighbors, and so those cells spawn. In the following round, there are neither cells that die nor cells that spawn, so we have a stable configuration. In general, a pattern that doesn't change is called a still-life.\n",
        "\n",
        "While all of these patterns stabilized quickly, some patterns take a long time to stabilize, and some never do. Of those that never stabilize, some at least have a regularity to them; they eventually eventually repeat states. These are said to be oscillators. Others never repeat the same state again, and produce an infinite number of configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be creating the game of living using two different classes, one for the game board, and one for each cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Cell\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cell class should have four object variables:  ints x and y, which represent its location the board, Boolean alive which is true if the cell is alive, and false if it's not, and Boolean last, which stores whether or not it was alive on the last turn (this is helpful for when we are updating the board).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code section below, you should add the following methods to the Cell class:\n",
        "\n",
        "**init(self,x,y,alive)**  The init method should take in parameters *x,y* and *alive*, and save them in object variables (using the self keyword).  It should also set the *last* variable equal to the alive parameter.  You should set the alive parameter to have a default value of False.\n",
        "\n",
        "**countNeighbors(self, cells)** countNeighbors should take in a list of lists of cells representing the grid, and return the number of neighbors of the current cell that are alive.  Remember that the cell will have 8 neighbors.  See the Dealing with Edges section below for more about count neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**update(self, cells)** This should call your countNeighbors method, and use it to update the alive value of your cell.  You should use the last value to decide if your cell is currently alive or dead, and then use the count of its neighbors to update it accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dealing with Edges**\n",
        "\n",
        "The edges of the board tend to be problematic. For example, if you are considering cell (WIDTH-1,HEIGHT-1) and you attempt to check the liveness of its neighbors as you would for most cells, you'll end up attempting to access positions whose indices are too large. \n",
        "\n",
        "One natural fix is to simply create a board that is 2 units taller and 2 units wider than you actually want, and only do updates on non-border cells. This approach would work fine, but on this lab you're going to do something a bit different; we're going to use a torus rather than a plane for our game board. A torus is just the technical name for the shape of a donut.\n",
        "\n",
        "OK, so what does that mean here? It means that if you were to walk off the right side of the board, you'd appear on the left side at the corresponding position, and vice-versa. Likewise if you walked off the top of the board, you'd appear on the bottom. This means every cell has 8 neighbors now. Consider cell (0,0). It has the 3 obvious neighbors in the directions E, SE and S. If we want to find the N neighbor, we have to wrap around the top of the board, bringing us to (0, h-1). Similarly, the NE neighbor would be (1, h-1). The NW neighbor would be (w-1, h-1), and so on. One reason this is so handy is that if you use the mod operator appropriately, you don't need any special cases to handle edges or corners.\n",
